Converts various sources of cultural heritage data into RDF

The AdamNet Foundation creates Linked Open Data from cultural heritage metadata in Amsterdam (NL). Therefor it:
- creates a list of reference terms that link the metadata for streets, buildings, neighbourhoods and persons (available on https://www.adamlink.nl)
- converts existing datasets of participating cultural heritage institutes into RDF (subject of this rep)
- makes it available on a SPARQL-endpoint via https://data.adamlink.nl/
